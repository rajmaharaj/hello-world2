# hello-world2
just another repository




Commits to master after it was branched, to force merge conflicts when creating PR's. DONE

Commit to local and see if git picks up lack of sync caused between local and remote, Then Push local to remote. DONE

Commit to remote, see if git picks up lack of sync and then push to local. DONE but in local (or remote for that matter), git did not seem to pick up the lack of sync and ask me to pull likeit did for push.

Try again. Commit on main branch on remote. Fetch that commit to local. Then merge. See if any difference.
